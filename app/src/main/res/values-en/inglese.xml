    <string name="istruzioni1">On the display at the centre of the web there are
    three spiders, ready to hide along the branches of the web.</string>
     <string name="istruzioni2">Pay attention to the leds which light up:
        they will show the path of their same color spider.</string>
    <string name="istruzioni3">When the leds turn off, it means that the spiders hid into
        one of the hubs. Drag the spider on the right hub and, when you\'re done, submit your answer.</string>
    <string name="istruzioni4">If you guess right where the spiders are hiding, you win.
    Have fun trying more difficult levels, increasing the speed of the spiders.</string>
